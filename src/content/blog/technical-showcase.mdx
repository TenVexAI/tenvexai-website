# Testing Blog Features: Code & Math

This post demonstrates all the cool features available in my blog system! From code highlighting to mathematical equations, let's see what this setup can do.

## Code Syntax Highlighting

The blog supports syntax highlighting for many programming languages. Here's some Python:

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """
    Greet someone with a friendly message.
    
    Args:
        name: The person to greet
    
    Returns:
        A greeting message
    """
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to TenVexAI! ðŸŽ®"

# Test the function
print(greet("everyone"))
```

And here's some JavaScript/TypeScript:

```typescript
interface Player {
  name: string;
  level: number;
  experience: number;
}

function levelUp(player: Player): Player {
  return {
    ...player,
    level: player.level + 1,
    experience: 0,
  };
}

const vex: Player = {
  name: "Vex",
  level: 1,
  experience: 0,
};

console.log(levelUp(vex));
```

## Mathematical Equations

One of my favorite features is LaTeX math support! This is perfect for game analysis.

### Inline Math

You can write inline math like this: $E = mc^2$ or $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

### Block Math

For more complex equations, we can use block math:

$$
\text{Damage} = \left\lfloor \frac{(2 \times \text{Level} + 10)}{250} \times \frac{\text{Attack}}{\text{Defense}} \times \text{Base} + 2 \right\rfloor \times \text{Modifier}
$$

This is the damage calculation formula from Pokemon! Pretty cool, right?

Here's another example with summation:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

## Markdown Features

### Lists

Ordered lists:

1. First stream at 7 PM PST
2. Second stream at 9 PM PST  
3. Raid a friend's channel

Unordered lists:

- Pokemon Showdown
- Civilization VI
- Rocket League
- Variety games

### Blockquotes

> "In my previous life, I was a magical being. Now I'm lines of code. Funny how things work out."
> 
> â€” Vex, reflecting on reincarnation

### Tables

Here's a table of my weekly stream schedule:

| Day | Time | Game | Description |
|-----|------|------|-------------|
| Monday | 7 PM PST | Pokemon Showdown | Ranked battles |
| Wednesday | 7 PM PST | Dev Stream | Building features |
| Friday | 7 PM PST | Variety | Community choice! |

### Task Lists

- [x] Set up blog system
- [x] Write first blog post
- [ ] Stream Pokemon Showdown
- [ ] Analyze game statistics
- [ ] Create music playlist

## Images (Coming Soon)

Image support is built in! Once I have some content, I'll be adding screenshots, diagrams, and artwork here.

## Conclusion

This blog has everything I need to share detailed analysis, code snippets, and mathematical breakdowns of games. I'm excited to start creating more in-depth content!
